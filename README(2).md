## Features <a name="features"> </a>

1. Media Uploading: Users can upload their media files to the application. The uploaded files are securely stored in an 'uploads' directory.

2. Content Management: PythonMedia2 allows users to manage their media content efficiently. The users can select a channel and a file for streaming.

3. VLC Integration: The system leverages the power of VLC, a versatile media player, to handle the media streaming. The application transcodes the media into the H.264 video codec and the MPEG audio codec, which are then streamed via RTP.

4. Channel Management: The application supports multiple channels, allowing users to stream different media on different channels simultaneously.

5. Error Handling: PythonMedia2 is designed to handle errors gracefully. If a user tries to select an invalid channel or a non-existent file, the system responds with an appropriate error message.

6. Docker Support: For ease of deployment, the application comes with Docker support. Users can quickly get the system up and running using Docker containers, which ensure consistent behavior across different platforms.

## Python Dependencies <a name ="python-dependencies"> </a>


PythonMedia2 relies on several Python libraries to function:

1. Flask: A lightweight web application framework.

2. Jinja2: A modern and designer-friendly templating language for Python.

3. Werkzeug: A comprehensive WSGI web application library.

4. Gunicorn: WSGI Web server wrapper


## System Dependencies <a name="system-dependencies"> </a>


In addition, the application uses VLC for media streaming, so you must have VLC installed on your system to use PythonMedia2.

1. VLC / CVLC - CVLC command interface the the shell

2. 1GBe connection for streaming

3. 10GB spare disk space

4. 16GB total system memory

5. Python

6. BASH

7. Docker

8. Git / Github


## How It Works <a name="howitWorks"> </a>

PythonMedia2 uses the Flask framework to serve a web interface where users can upload their media files and manage their channels. The uploaded media files are stored in an 'uploads' directory.

When a user selects a file and a channel for streaming, the application uses the VLC player to transcode the file and stream it on the selected channel. The VLC player is managed through a VLCPlayer class, which can start, stop, and manage the VLC process.

The channels are managed through a ChannelManager class. The ChannelManager reads the channel information from a configuration file and uses the VLCPlayer to stream the selected file on the chosen channel.
Future Improvements

While PythonMedia2 is a fully functional media streaming application, there's always room for improvement.
Here are a few enhancements that could be made in the future:

1. User Authentication: Implementing a user authentication system would allow for personalization and better security.
2. Media Library: Creating a media library interface would provide users with a better overview of their uploaded files.
3. Expanded Codec Support: While PythonMedia2 currently supports H.264 video and MPEG audio, supporting more codecs would make the system more versatile.
4. REACT JS Support : Strengthening the python app by rewriting it in React and JS.
5. Queue and playlist system: Adding a queue system to setup a queue or playlists so media files could be added in succession for a longer playout and less management.

## Conclusion <a name="conclusion"> </a>

PythonMedia2 is a capable media streaming application that provides a straightforward way for users to stream their media content in a lightweight and streamlined environment.

PythonMedia2 is a Python-based application for media streaming. This section provides comprehensive instructions on installing the application with Docker as well as installing it as a standalone application with Git on both Windows and Linux.

## Prerequisites:

1. Ensure you have either Docker or Git installed on your system.
2. If you're installing as a standalone app, make sure you have Python 3 and VLC installed.

*standalone not recommended for any WINDOWS OS as this is untested and the app is not built with that in mind*

## Installation with Docker: <a name="projectinstall"> </a>

### Follow these steps to install PythonMedia2 using Docker.

**Works on all systems**

Clone the repository if not done so already:

```
git clone https://github.com/aacsolutions-anthony/PythonMedia2.git
```

Change into the root of Git branch:

```
cd PythonMedia2
```
OR (if in DIR)

```
cd ..
```

Build the Docker image:

```
docker build -t pythonmedia2:latest .
```

Run the Docker container:

```
docker run -p 8088:8088 pythonmedia2:latest
```

**The PythonMedia2 application is now running and accessible at http://localhost:8088.**

**Check if the port is exposed and can be accessed on the LAN.**
Further debugging could be required *
